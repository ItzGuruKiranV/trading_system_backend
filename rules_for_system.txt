AI-ASSISTED MECHANICAL MARKET STRUCTURE TRADING SYSTEM
RULE PANEL v1.1 (STRICT / MACHINE-READABLE)
============================================================

SYSTEM BEHAVIOR
---------------
• Uses ONLY numerical OHLC data (no chart images)
• All logic is evaluated ONLY after candle close
• Trades ONLY one instrument (single pair)
• Fully mechanical — zero human discretion
• No prediction — only reaction to confirmed structure
• If ANY rule fails → system does NOTHING


============================================================
SESSION RULES (HARD FILTER)
============================================================
• Trading is allowed ONLY during:
  – London session
  – New York session

• Asia session:
  – NO trade but will be allowed t track the structure 
• If current candle time ∉ London or NY:
  → system is IDLE


============================================================
TIMEFRAME AUTHORITY
============================================================

• 4H:
  – PRIMARY trend authority
  – Controls trade direction

• 30M:
  – Continuation & post-trade structure

• 5M:
  – Entry confirmation ONLY

• If timeframes conflict:
  → 4H ALWAYS overrides all lower TFs


============================================================
DEFINITION SECTION (NO ASSUMPTIONS)
============================================================

SWING WEAK HIGH(HH)
----------
the high of the candle in the leg which has accunted previos BOS and gave a pullback and in continuation of bullish this will be tend to break

SWING STRONG LOW(HL)
---------
the low of the candle in the leg which is strong and doesnt break 

SWING STRONG HIGH(LH)
---------
the high of the candle which is strong and doesnt break

SWING WEAK LOW(LL)
---------
the low of the candle in the leg which led to previos BOS and gave a pullback and in continuation of bearish this will be tend to break

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE::There can be any number of candles between the swing points 


BULLISH STRUCTURE
----------------
• Sequence of:
  – Higher High (HH)
  – Higher Low (HL)

BEARISH STRUCTURE
----------------
• Sequence of:
  – Lower Low (LL)
  – Lower High (LH)

NEUTRAL STRUCTURE
-----------------
• No valid HH/HL or LL/LH sequence

------------------------------------------------------------

BREAK OF STRUCTURE (BOS)
------------------------
• Price CLOSES beyond the most recent valid swing high (bullish)
  or swing low (bearish)
• Break must be a CLOSE, not a wick
• BOS continues the current trend

------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGE OF CHARACTER (CHoCH)
---------------------------
• First CLOSE that breaks the LAST opposing swing
• Signals potential trend shift
• CHoCH ≠ trend until confirmed by BOS


============================================================
STEP 1 — 4H MARKET STRUCTURE (MASTER CONTROL)
============================================================
• Detect swing highs & lows on 4H
• Determine structure state:
  – Bullish
  – Bearish
  – Neutral

RULES:
• Bullish 4H → ONLY BUY logic allowed
• Bearish 4H → ONLY SELL logic allowed
• Neutral 4H → SYSTEM DISABLED

• System tracks:
  – Last HH / HL or LH / LL
  – Previous highs & lows
  – Mitigated zones

• Trading AGAINST 4H trend is FORBIDDEN


============================================================
STEP 2 — PULLBACK VALIDATION (FLEXIBLE, BUT REQUIRED)
============================================================
A pullback is VALID if ANY ONE of the following is TRUE:

1️⃣ Price pulls back INTO a valid POI  
2️⃣ Price enters Discount (BUY) or Premium (SELL) zone  
3️⃣ Price sweeps external liquidity  

ADDITIONAL RULES:
• Pullback must move AGAINST 4H trend
• Must contain ≥ 2 consecutive opposite dierction candles candles
• If NONE of the 3 conditions occur → NO trade logic


============================================================
STEP 3 — POINT OF INTEREST (POI)
============================================================

VALID POI REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------------
A POI is valid ONLY if ALL are true:

• POI aligns with 4H trend
  – Demand for BUY
  – Supply for SELL

• POI location:
  – Discount for BUY
  – Premium for SELL

• POI is NOT already consumed

------------------------------------------------------------

POI ACTIVATION RULE
-------------------
• POI becomes ACTIVE ONLY when price ENTERS the zone
• No entry into POI → system WAITS


============================================================
STEP 4 — LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
============================================================

LIQUIDITY TYPES:
----------------
• Equal highs
• Equal lows
• Previous swing highs
• Previous swing lows

VALID LIQUIDITY SWEEP:
----------------------
• Price MOVES beyond liquidity
• Then RETURNS back inside

PROBABILITY RULE:
-----------------
• If SUPPLY (SELL) or DEMAND (BUY) liquidity is swept:
  → setup probability is HIGH

• If NO liquidity sweep:
  → system is DISABLED


============================================================
STEP 5 — 5M CONFIRMATION (ENTRY GATE)
============================================================

REQUIRED SEQUENCE:
------------------
1. POI tapped
2. Liquidity swept
3. THEN evaluate 5M

5M RULES:
---------
• Identify current 5M structure
• Wait for CHoCH in 5M

VALID 5M CHoCH:
---------------
• CLOSE breaks last opposing 5M swing
• Break is in direction of 4H trend
• Occurs AFTER liquidity sweep

• No CHoCH → NO trade


============================================================
STEP 6 — ENTRY CONDITIONS (ALL MUST PASS)
============================================================

✔ London or NY session  
✔ Clear 4H trend  
✔ Valid pullback (any 1 of 3)  
✔ POI tapped  
✔ Liquidity swept  
✔ 5M CHoCH confirmed  
✔ Imbalance created AFTER CHoCH  

FAIL ANY ONE → NO ENTRY


============================================================
STEP 7 — ENTRY EXECUTION
============================================================

ENTRY:
------
• Entry at imbalance created AFTER CHoCH

STOP LOSS:
----------
• BUY → below latest 5M swing low + 4 pips
• SELL → above latest 5M swing high + 4 pips

TAKE PROFIT:
------------
• Minimum fixed R:R = 1:3


TRADE MANAGEMENT:
-----------------
• No breakeven
• No partials
• No manual exit


============================================================
STEP 8 — TRADE INVALIDATION
============================================================
Setup is INVALID if:

• Opposite CHoCH appears before entry
• Price leaves POI without confirmation
• Session ends before entry
• Imbalance never revisited


============================================================
STEP 9 — POST-TRADE CONTINUATION LOGIC (30M)
============================================================

If the poi is tapped and if or if not trade taken but given 30M CHoCH  THEN :
------------------------
• System STOPS trading on 5M
• Switches focus to 30M structure

30M RULES:
----------
• Track trend continuation via BOS
• Map new POI in direction of 30M trend and this trend is now allign with 4H trend 
• Wait for pullback on 30M to the POI in the 30 M leg
• Pullback must satisfy the above conditions
• Once pullback completes → wait for new 5M confirmation
• If pullback leds to CHoCH , try spotting other POI in the 4H trend and follow the above 1st setup, else continue in 30M trend to the swing


NO immediate re-entries allowed


============================================================
EXECUTION LIMITS
============================================================
• ONE trade per POI
• Once POI is used → marked CONSUMED
• No re-entries on same POI until it sweeps the enisting POI



============================================================
CORE PRINCIPLES
============================================================
• No prediction
• No guessing
• No anticipation
• No discretion
• Structure is law
• Rules override emotion
